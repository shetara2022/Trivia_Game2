# Trivia_Game2

This is an updated version of the original trivia game, created for Milestone Project One of my full stack development bootcamp. 

## Trivia Inspiration: 

This general knowledge trivia game was designed with every student at heart. As an educator, I enjoy playing trivia games 

with my students for practice of skills but also as a fun way to discover new and interesting facts!   

How to play: 

On the intro screen, there are a set of rules to follow. The rules are as follows: 
1. Click the button of the correct answer. 
2. You will not be able to change your response once selected! 
3. Your total score will be revealed at the end of the game.


Once the "Let's Play" button has been selected, you will immediately begin playing the trivia. 
There is a question counter and score displayed on the screen. Click the correct answer. 
If the answer is 'correct', the container will turn green; if the answer is 'incorrect', the container will turn red. 

If you complete the trivia, a congratulations screen will display to show the number of questions you answered correctly.
 
This game was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Local storage has been added, which makes it possible to save your score! 
SASS has been implemented.
